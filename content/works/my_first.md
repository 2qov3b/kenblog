Just don't know what to do w/ myself.
Read lots of things still need to verify little bit.

By the way, [Alluxio](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio) looks fun, it is shown [here](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/). WOW, storage layer in _BDAS_ and maybe it will be hot like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/).

Well, the [paper](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2018/EECS-2018-29.pdf) shows the architecture. Hopefully I can found some new ideas from it, cheers!!!
